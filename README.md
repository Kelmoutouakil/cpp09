# CPP Pool - Day 09: 42 School

## Overview
This project is part of the 42 School curriculum, focusing on advanced C++ programming concepts. Day 09 emphasizes enhancing understanding and proficiency in C++ features, including STL (Standard Template Library) and other advanced topics.

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with C++ advanced features.
- Explore and implement concepts related to containers, algorithms, and iterators.
- Understand the usage and benefits of STL components.

## Topics Covered
1. **STL Containers**:
   - `vector`, `list`, `map`, `set`, and more.
   - When to use each container and its advantages.

2. **Iterators**:
   - Introduction to different types of iterators: input, output, forward, bidirectional, and random access.
   - Using iterators with containers.

3. **Algorithms**:
   - Applying STL algorithms like `sort`, `find`, `accumulate`, etc.
   - Using custom comparison functions and predicates.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - Understanding and implementing exception safety in programs.

5. **Advanced Concepts**:
   - Understanding memory management with smart pointers.
   - Implementing and using function objects and lambdas.
